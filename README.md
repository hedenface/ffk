> fucking free kanban

## Introduction

This is a basic, free, open source kanban board. You host it yourself,
and you use it. If you need functionality that it doesn't provide, you
can either not use it, or build the functionality that you require.

## Under Development

This project is currently under development. In order to get it
working for you locally, you simply need to copy the contents of the
`src/` directory (including subdirectories) to somewhere on your
web server (probably `/var/www/html/` or something like that).
